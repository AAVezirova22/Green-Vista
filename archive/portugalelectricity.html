    <p>Portugal got exactly three-quarters (75%) of its electricity from renewable sources in the first half of 2023, according to data collated by energy research group Ember.</p>
    <br>
    <p>That was partly thanks to a rebound in hydroelectricity output following a drought the year before, and a steady increase in wind and solar installations driven by an ambitious procurement programme that started in 2019.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Solar production was up 40% in a year, according to Ember analyst Matt Ewen, who says that figure may even be understated since the grid operator doesn’t report data on behind-the-meter rooftop solar.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“I don’t have any estimates of this, but anecdotally it seems like rooftop solar deployment has been quite substantial,” Ewen says.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the first half of the year, wind was the single biggest contributor to the nation’s power mix, followed by hydro. The rising share of clean energy helped Portugal slash its gas consumption by 21% year on year, according to energy agency ADENE.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The country’s electricity mix has changed fast, with the share of renewables up from 27% in 2005 and 54% in 2017. The last coal-fired power plant was shut in 2021.</p>
