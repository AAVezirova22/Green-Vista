    <p>European lawmakers, after an unexpectedly bitter political battle, approved a bill on Wednesday that would require European Union countries to restore 20 percent of nature areas within their borders on land and at sea.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The measure, a key element of the bloc’s Green Deal environmental initiative, passed with 336 votes in favor, 300 against and 13 abstentions. It now goes to a committee of representatives from the E.U. executive, Parliament and national governments.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Negotiations on a final version could take months. But the vote on Wednesday at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, means the bloc is now required in principle to pass the measure into law.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The bill approved by Parliament was a modified version of the original proposal. Lawmakers had submitted more than 2,300 amendments, an unusual number, and accused one another of spreading disinformation. The law initially failed to pass three committee votes after marathon late-night sessions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A day before the final vote, scores of environmental activists, including Greta Thunberg, faced off against angry farmers on tractors from all over Europe in scorching heat outside Parliament in Strasbourg. 
        Farmers are a key constituency in Parliament’s biggest political group, the center-right European People’s Party, which led opposition to the bill. Together with smaller far-right groupings, they said the proposed policy would threaten food production, cause a surge in inflation and harm farmers, who have already been hurt by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
