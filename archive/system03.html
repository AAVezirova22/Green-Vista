    <p>The Ocean Cleanup develops and scales technologies to rid the oceans of plastic. To achieve this, we have focused our initial ocean cleaning efforts where we can make maximum impact: the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (or GPGP) located between California and Hawaii, where our first experimental large-scale cleaning solution, System 002, has been harvesting plastic throughout its 2021 and 2022 test campaigns.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our ocean cleaning technology is now validated, and consistent removal of plastic from the GPGP is now a reality. The next step in our mission is to transition from this successful trial system toward a system large and efficient enough to clean the entire GPGP.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We now move towards the scale-up phase of our project with System 03, three times the size of System 002 and capable of capturing much larger quantities of plastic at a lower cost per kilogram removed on a continuous year-round basis. We believe the huge increases in both size and uptime can result in a system that is ten times as effective as its predecessor.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Cleaning the entire GPGP requires a blueprint for our ocean cleaning systems. With System 03, we aim to deliver the blueprint design for scaling toward a fleet of systems.</p>
    <br>
    <p>System 002 demonstrated that The Ocean Cleanup’s systems can successfully and consistently harvest plastic. Now this is proven, the transition to System 03 and parallel test campaign will allow us to progress to the next phase of our cleanup – optimizing our blueprint and expanding to a full fleet of systems to clean the entire GPGP.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To do this, we are focusing on one performance indicator above all: our cost per kilogram of plastic removed from the ocean.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To rid the oceans of plastic, we need a cleanup approach that can match the immense size of the problem. The GPGP covers a massive area – three times the size of France, or twice the size of Texas – and cleaning the whole thing requires a fleet of systems. How big this fleet needs to be, and the costs of producing and operating that fleet, will depend on the size, performance, and capture efficiency of the individual systems. By increasing size, optimizing operational performance (i.e., less downtime), and increasing capture efficiency, we aim to produce a much more efficient system that will become the blueprint for our fleet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In simple terms: using bigger systems makes cleaning the ocean more economical.</p>
